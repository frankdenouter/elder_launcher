## Important Rules
1. Please make your commits in a new **feature** or **patch** branch.
2. Do not push Pubspec files unless a dependency change is necessary.

Aside from this, the guidelines stated below are very lax and you can start contributing in no time.

## Features and UI/UX Changes
Elder Launcher focuses on **Legibility** and **Simplicity**. All new features and visual changes must adhere to this.

Before working on any new major features or changing the appearance of the app, please post about in the relevant section of the project's Github Discussions [page](https://github.com/itsarjunsinh/elder_launcher/discussions). This is to ensure your work aligns with the vision of the project.

## Translations
Improving or providing translations is hugely beneficial to many users and is highly appreciated. However, please send a separate PR for translation changes.
ie. Do not include them with a bugfix/feature/UI-changes PR.

❌ Commit: Added Welsh; Fixed (some bug)

❌ Commit: Added Welsh; Added (some feature)

✔️ Commit: Added Welsh

This rule doesn't apply, if your code requires strings which don't exist in the project.

✔️ Commit: Added (some feature) and (some strings for the feature)

## Code Quality
Please follow existing indentation pattern of the project. PRs that don't reflect this, will be rejected for the sake of consistency.

> *Code styling guidelines will be added in the future.*
